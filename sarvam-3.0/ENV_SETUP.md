# Environment Variables Setup

This document explains how to set up environment variables for both development and production.

## Server Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `server/` directory:

```bash
# server/.env

# Google Gemini API Key (REQUIRED)
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Server Port (optional, defaults to 3001)
PORT=3001
```

### Getting Your Gemini API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the key and paste it into your `.env` file

## Client Environment Variables

Create environment files in the `client/` directory:

### Development (client/.env.development)
```bash
# Backend API URL for development
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
```

### Production (client/.env.production)
```bash
# Backend API URL for production
# Update this with your actual Vercel deployment URL
VITE_API_URL=https://your-vercel-domain.vercel.app/api
```

## Vercel Environment Variables

When deploying to Vercel, you need to add environment variables in the Vercel dashboard:

1. Go to your Vercel project settings
2. Navigate to "Environment Variables"
3. Add the following variables:

| Variable Name | Value | Environment |
|--------------|-------|-------------|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Your Gemini API key | Production, Preview, Development |
| `VITE_API_URL` | Your Vercel API URL | Production |

### Steps to Add in Vercel Dashboard:

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Go to "Settings" ‚Üí "Environment Variables"
4. Click "Add New"
5. Enter variable name and value
6. Select which environments to apply (Production, Preview, Development)
7. Click "Save"

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:**
- Never commit `.env` files to Git
- The `.env` files are included in `.gitignore` for security
- Always use environment variables for sensitive data
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use different API keys for development and production if possible

## Verification

After setting up environment variables:

1. **Development:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   node index.js
   # Should see: "üöÄ Server running on port 3001"
   ```

2. **Client:**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run dev
   # Should connect to backend without errors
   ```

3. **Vercel:**
   - After deployment, check the deployment logs
   - Test the API endpoint: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/health`
